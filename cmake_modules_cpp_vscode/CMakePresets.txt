This file is used to set up tools that support C++20 modules.

The "base" configure preset is using the "Ninja" build system.
But on windows ("windows-base") we make sure to be using the Visual Studio 17 2022 generator.

To see the available generators just go to Terminal, type:
    cmake --help 
This will list the them. The CMake documentation explains this ("Generator Support" in the CMake modules page).

Then the compiler is specified in CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER.

In Linux be sure to have Ninja installed because it is required.

This file is a presets file and we should configure it:
    ctrl + shift + p (command palette) -> CMake: Select configure preset
In this case we use windows-base.

Then we have to select a Build preset:
    Command Palette -> CMake: Select build preset
In this case we use windows-build

Other CMake commands:
cmake --version
